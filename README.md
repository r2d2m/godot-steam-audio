# godot-steam-audio
This is a GDExtension that integrates the [steam-audio](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/) library into Godot.

Right now, this extension still needs a [fork](https://github.com/stechyo/godot) of Godot to work, because
some internal functions aren't exposed (https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/8609). Once
either my PR gets merged or someone else exposes these functions, the extension will work with an official
version of godot. Linux and Windows are currently working, and macOS probably works, but I don't have the time
nor the money to support Mac, sorry.

This extension is in an experimental phase, will have bugs and missing polish, and may likely have
crashes.

### Features 
 - Spatial ambisonics audio 
 - Occlusion and transmission through geometry 
 - Distance attenuation

 To come: 
 - More editor configuration
 - Reflections (reverb)

### Installation
 - Download the [latest release](https://github.com/stechyo/godot/releases/tag/steam-audio) or clone and build [my fork of Godot](https://github.com/stechyo/godot/tree/4.2-gdext/audio-stream-funcs).
 - Download the [latest release](https://github.com/stechyo/godot-steam-audio/releases) of the extension or build it yourself.
 - Download the [latest supported release](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-audio/releases/tag/v4.5.0) of steam-audio, and copy the binaries 
   that you find in the `lib` folder for your operating system to the `bin/` folder of your project, which 
   should contain a `libgodot-steam-audio` library (.dll or .so) and a .gdextension file.

Your project should have a `bin/` folder with:
 - `libgodot-steam-audio.gdextension`
 - `libgodot-steam-audio.linux.template_debug.x86_64` for Linux, or a similar .dll for Windows
 - `libphonon.so` for Linux, or `phonon.dll` and some other files for Windows - these are the steam-audio lib
   binaries.

### Project setup
In the `project` folder you have an example setup. Basically, you need:
 - A `SteamAudioConfig` object in your scene
 - A `SteamAudioListener`, which you probably want to keep inside your `Camera3D`
 - `SteamAudioPlayer`s for each sound source that you want to use steam-audio on, each with a set sub_stream
   and with a `SteamAudioStream`
 - `SteamAudioGeometry` for each `MeshInstance3D` that you want to use for sound occlusion

### Contributing 
This extension expects the steam-audio lib to be placed in `src/lib/steamaudio` in order to compile.
Check the Makefile for an example install.
